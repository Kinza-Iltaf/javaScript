<!-- 
js is synchronous language
one by one execution

single threaded language : slow language but not mostly available alone js engine, it come with run time environment (browser, node.js)

the above was about default js

Execution context => 

execution line by line (first line then second, can not jump to new without finishing the old one)

two type of code

1. blocking code => block the flow of the code(meeting k doran manager ko call aagy so on k wapis aanay tak hum agay proceed nahy kaar saktain)

2. non blocking code => not block the execution till its availability we can do something else(ami kana bana rahy hain to es duration main hum kuch or kar saktain hain)
