<!-- 
js is synchronous language
one by one execution

single threaded language : slow language but not mostly available alone js engine, it come with run time environment (browser, node.js)

the above was about default js

Execution context => 

execution line by line (first line then second, can not jump to new without finishing the old one)

two type of code

1. blocking code => block the flow of the code(meeting k doran manager ko call aagy so on k wapis aanay tak hum agay proceed nahy kaar saktain)

2. non blocking code => not block the execution till its availability we can do something else(ami kana bana rahy hain to es duration main hum kuch or kar saktain hain)

file reading is nightmare in OS => bcz its done by kernal 

non blocking code and blocking code depend upon use cases

task queue make the js fast and asynch 

web API => browser => DOM support

promises / high priority queue

machanism which remind us about pending task => web APIs => setTimeOut (baqy kam karo or time honay k bad main aap ko yad dela do gha)

new API added to JS => fetch API => give Promises (tell about task whether its successful or not) (es main b task queue ke tarah call back hotain hain) 

its little bit of high priority
